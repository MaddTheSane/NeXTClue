Clue is a NeXTstep implementation of the Parker Brothers' board game.

Clue is "freeware".  You may use and enjoy this program for free.  You may
make and distribute unmodified copies of this program for free provided
that: (a) the program is distributed in its entirety without modification,
and (b) no fee of any kind is collected for the distribution of the program.

To install:
cd /Games                               # Wherever you install games.
gnutar xzf Clue.1.0.NIHS.b.tar.gz       # Creates Clue.app

No special permissions are required other than the ordinary permissions to 
create files in a directory.  

This package contains only the binary executable.  The program uses a 
private "pre-release" version of the MiscTableScroll object which we have 
not published yet.  I will probably release the source code in a separate 
distribution after the appropriate version of the MiscTableScroll object is 
publicly available, 


Paul McCarthy wrote the program.
Eric Sunshine provided additional programming.
Cody McCarthy drew the suspect icons.
