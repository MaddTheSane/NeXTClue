v22 Sat May 31 16:24:24 EDT 1997 zarnuk
    Fixed up PB files.  I purged a lot of junk files from the directory
	in v21, but PB still had references to some of them.
    Info panel now makes key when ordered front, so that cmd-w will
	close it.
    Repackaged tiffs so that they are read-only.

	Changed Files:
	* ClueInfo.M
	* Makefile
	* PB.project
	- room.tiff

v21 Sat May 31 15:49:05 EDT 1997 zarnuk
    Erik fiddled with the ClueHuman nib and scrunched it.
    Anna Lyzer (hence Dee Ducer and Cy Borg) were revealing new
	cards when they could have revealed previously revealed
	cards.
    Fixed bug: 'assert( g == x )' ClueAnnaLyzer.M:236 was failing due to
	a rare bug in ClueCondArray::minCardsForPlayer().  (Used by Dee
	Ducer and Cy Borg).
    NOTE: PB make "depend" is broken for .M and .cc files.
    Added more speculation to Cy Borg.  Cy Borg is slightly better than
	Dee Ducer now.
    Moved everything into RCS.
    Fixed bug: ClueHuman sometimes restored pieces to saved locations
    	on top of other pieces.
    Info panel now reads the version number out of the PACKAGE_NUMBER file.

v20 Mon May 19 18:44:40 EDT 1997 zarnuk
    Implementing Cy Borg.
    Added labels to rooms on board.
    Removed grid from interior of rooms.
    ClueHuman now starts out with the player's own piece on the
	suspect pop-up to avoid dragging other pieces into the room.
    Added divider rows to notebook.
    Removed obsolete OK button.
    Fixed the size of the app icon.

    Added "Cy Borg" (still under construction).
    Simplified some code in ClueHuman.M

v17 Fri May  9 18:26:04 EDT 1997 zarnuk
    Trivial wording changes to rules.
    Fixed erik's right-mouse-menu new-game bug.
    Tuned the suspect tiffs a little.  Made their outlines darker so that
	they are easier to see when they are in rooms with similar color,
	and when they are on their own starting squares.
    Straightened out the main nib.  Forget what NeXT guidelines say.
	They are wrong.  Humans work better with broad and shallow menu
	structures, not narrow and deep ones.  Besides, this is not a
	document-oriented program.  The game submenu was pointless and
	annoying.
    Fixed major bugs: Now checks to make sure that you can roll and move
	before enabling the roll button.  Now checks to see whether there
	are any legal squares to move to for the given die roll.
    Fixed major bug: If there is no legal move (no passage, can't stay,
	can't roll), then it presents a special message and enables the
	"Stay" button, but this does not let the player make a suggestion
	there.
    Fixed major bug: Pressing "skip" for a suggestion would leave the
	"pre-selected" suspect and weapon in the room instead of restoring
	them to their correct location.
    Fixed the printing bugs.

	Changed Files:
	* Clue.nib
	* ClueBoard.{M|nib}
	* ClueMap.{cc|h}
	* ClueMessages.M

	* all suspect tiffs.


v16 Fri May  9 03:43:08 EDT 1997 sunshine
    Fixed wording in rules.
    Slight reworking of main menu.  Removed "Help" item for now since there
	is no help.  (Can easily be re-added later if needed.)
    Fixed bug: ClueMessages was leaking a ClueTrace.
    ClueBoard now closes its window before freeing it.

	Changed Files:
	* Clue.nib
	* ClueBoard.{h|M}
	* ClueMessages.M
	* ClueRules.rtfd


v15 Fri May  9 02:19:08 EDT 1997 zarnuk
    Folded-out the pause after making a suggestion.
    Now saves/restores the location of suspects/weapons when making
	suggestions.
    Fixed drop-on-top bug.
    Fixed latent bug: players are returned to their starting position
	if they make an incorrect accusation.  This moves them out
	of the corridors, and prevents them from blocking the movement
	of the other players.
    Erikz changez:
    Improved wording/formatting of rules.  Added more detailed description.
    Rules now load from a file.

	Changed Files:
	* Clue.nib
	* ClueBoardView.{h|M}

	+ ClueRules.rtfd

v14 Thu May  8 00:20:26 EDT 1997 zarnuk/sunshine
    Removed green background from weapon tiffs.
    Fixed bug: ClueHuman suggest pop-ups were not initialized
	properly when loaded from nibs.
    Eric added up/down cursor keys and single-click to edit to the
	table scroll on the ClueHuman window -- much nicer so far.
    Fixed bug: ClueHuman did not force player to move after rolling die.
    Fixed bug: failed assertion `goal_room != CLUE_CARD_MAX'.
    Can now drag suspect and weapon into room.

    Converted ClueHuman to use tags instead of strings for popups.
    ClueHuman now enforced to make legal suggestions.
    Fixed bug: ClueMgr was not allowing an accusation if the player
	did not (or could not) make a suggestion.
    ClueMgr now moves the weapon to the suggested room.
